Description: This package can be used to identify the reporting style of 
    p-values in a text. Specifically, with this package you can determine what 
    proportion of p-values in a text is reported inexactly (i.e., p < ... or 
    p > ..., instead of p = ...). Reporting a p-value in an inexact way is a 
    suboptimal reporting practice. With this package, these cases can be 
    flagged, so the author of the text can be notified of the quality of their
    reporting.
